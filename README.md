# Depth-Map-Prediction-From-Single-Image

This repo acts as a tutorial for the work done in the "Depth Map Prediction From a Single Image" [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2283). 
The goal is to predict the depth of objects in the image (how far from the camera).

The used architecture is as follows:
